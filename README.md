Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error. I will apply a deep learning model to the data, and change the hyperparameters like activation function, cost function, epochs, gradient estimation, network architecture and initialization, to find the higher accuracy model. By the way, I will use Keras merged with Tensorflow (eg. tf.keras.layers.Conv2D). For each hyperparameters, I will try severl variables and see how does it effect the accuracy and how does it effect how quickly the network plateaus.
